# restaurantql
using graphql

In this project, download the files in order to understand queries and mutations for GraphQL. You'll have to install the packages and then you can run the app. Use the following as a starter for GraphQL queries:

mutation editrestaurants($idd: Int = 1, $name: String = "OLDO") {
  editrestaurant(id: $idd, name: $name) {
    name
    description
  }
}

mutation setrestaurants {
  setrestaurant(input: {
    name: "Granite",
    description: "American",
  }) {
    name
    description
  }
}

mutation deleterestaurants($iid: Int = 1) {
  deleterestaurant(id: $iid) {
    ok
  }
}

query getrestaurants {
  restaurants {
    name
    description
    dishes {
      name
      price
    }
  }
}
